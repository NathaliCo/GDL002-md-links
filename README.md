# Markdown Links
**Markdown Links** is a tool for identify all the links that are inside of a file with .md extension or web page, and also helps you to identify broken and live links, and get a stats about those links like; how many links are inside your file, how many of them are alive, and wich ones are repeated.

With this tool you can also search for all the .md files inside a directory and perform all the aformentioned tasks.
